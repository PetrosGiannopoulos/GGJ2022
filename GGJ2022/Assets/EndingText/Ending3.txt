You wake up in the blank, empty and insanely white room of the mental ward. Was it a dream? Or a memory? You can't say for sure. The door opens (and you know that it's time for your injection and pills) ... Not this again... You thought you were a good person, you donâ€™t deserve this fate. They said it would help but the voices are still there, at the corner of your mind. Will your pain know no end?
