The town was…desperate. Everyone who tried to kill the beast never came back… Hercules and his companion Iolaus were brave or mad enough to accept the challenge. 

They could hear the monster but they could not see it. They shot fiery arrows to lure the beast and…

There it is! Nine heads… Shooting venom. Hercules battled the monstrosity and cut many heads, but his actions were futile: for every head that he cut, two more would grow in its place.

Iolaus used fire to stop the heads from respawning and Hercules used Athena’s golden sword to cut off the final head.  

The end.
