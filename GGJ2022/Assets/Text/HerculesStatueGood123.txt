Hercules' second labor was to get rid of the Lernaean Hydra. The Hydra was an enormous snake with 9 heads and poisonous breath that killed all who crossed its path. One of its heads was immortal - you couldn't kill it. But Hercules and Iolaus sworn to protect the people, and did not back down from the challenge. 

Hercules lured the monster out of the swamp with fiery arrows. He charged at the monster, with his massive club on both hands, ready to destroy the beast. He savagely started bludgeoning on its many heads, but it was futile. 

For every head that Hercules killed, two more would burst forth in its place. He instructed Iolaus to bring a torch, which he quickly applied to the severed necks of the beast, cauterizing the wounds and rendering the regeneration of the heads impossible.
