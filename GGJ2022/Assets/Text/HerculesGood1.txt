The demigod Hercules and, his companion, Iolaus sworn to protect the people from the great serpent: the Lernean Hydra. A beast with 9 heads and poisonous breath that killed all who crossed its path. 

But the battle was futile. For every head that he cut, two more would burst forth in its place. Only with the help of his companion was Hercules able to burn the wounds and stop the heads from respawning. 

He used the golden sword of the Goddess Athena to destroy the last, immortal, head and he buried it deep into the ground. To this day, it was never seen again. 

Both Hercules and Iolaus were hailed as heroes and will be remembered for all eternity.
